They’re so soft and they’re so furry
And they’re so cute if your visions blurry
all mine got free but don’t you worry
Though they’re crawling up your wall in a big hurry

CHORUS:
Tarantulas tarantulas
Everybody loves tarantulas
If there’s just fuzz where your hamster was
It’s probably because of tarantulas

Don’t look now but I have a feeling
There’s one above you on your ceiling
But when they crawl they never fall
Unless the person under them is nervous at all

CHORUS

Can you feel that itch on the top of your head
It could be the big one crawling instead
But it won’t bite unless it senses fear
So just stay calm til it’s gone in a year

CHORUS
